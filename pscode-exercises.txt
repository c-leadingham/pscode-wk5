// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 numbers together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


Display "This program will ask you for two numbers, add the two numbers, and generate a result. Please enter the  first number (A):"

Input (A)

Display "Please enter the second number (B):"

Input (B)

Display A+B 

Print Sum 

--END--


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Display "This program will test if a number is odd or even. Please enter the number (A):"

Use the modulo operator to see if the number can be divided by 2.
	- IF the remainder is 0, the number is even. 
		print "Even" 
	-ELSE IF the remainder is 1 
		THEN print "Odd" 

--END--


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered 
numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message 
describing what they are.


Display "This program will help you begin to work with data. Please choose five different numbers between 0 and 100: (A), (B), (C), (D), (E)." 

Display (A), (B), (C), (D), (E)

Add (A)+(B)+(C)+(D)+(E)

Divide sum by 5 to get an average

Display "This is the average of the dataset (A), (B), (C), (D), (E):"
	- print number average 

Display "This program will now identify the smallest and largest numbers in the dataset (A), (B), (C), (D), (E)"

Identify smallest number in data set (A), (B), (C), (D), (E)
	- print number (F)

Identify the largest number in the data set (A), (B), (C), (D), (E)
	- print number (G)

Display "This is the smallest number in the data set: (F)."

Display "This is the largest number in the data set: (G)."
